            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              As an Assistant Production Editor for
              <abbr title="Simon Fraser University">SFU</abbr>’s student
              newspaper <span class="italics">The Peak</span>, I designed print
              layouts for 4–5 pages each Production Day using Adobe InDesign.
              Implementing design feedback from the Production &amp; Design
              Editor, all spreads were completed quickly and with a high level
              of quality.

            <h3>First Draft</h3>
          <p>
            I first skimmed each article and noted any layout suggestions to
            better understand this piece of writing. For this Valentine’s-themed
            article, I was given a stock photo to use, and was requested to
            visually separate the paragraphs about Greek and Hindu expressions
            of love.

            This pastel colour palette and typeface pairing (<a

            and
            <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/questa-sans">Questa Sans</a>)
            were selected to resemble candy hearts. When sharing this first
            draft <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> with the
            editors, I commented that the chemistry pun stock photo didn't match
            the piece; they agreed and said they would find a replacement photo.

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Second Draft</h3>
          <p>
            In this second iteration, I adjusted my approach: candy hearts are a
            <em>Westernized</em> interpretation of love and Valentine’s Day, yet
            the article’s purpose was to highlight diverse celebrations of love
            <em>worldwide</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this new approach, I added dashed lines to suggest maps,
            travelling, and exploration.
          </p>
          </div>
          <img
            src="../img/peak/love-around-world-2.jpg"
            alt="Second draft of the layout for “Love Makes the World Go Round”"
            width="2485"
            height="1920"
          />

        <section id="final-layout" class="grid two-column add-gutters">
          <div class="column">
            <h3>Finalized Layout &amp; Custom Illustration</h3>
          <p>
            To replace the stock photo, I selected a few love-related ideas from
            the article and illustrated them using Adobe Illustrator, formatting
            them to look like Polaroid photos. These reinforced the travel
            theme, as if the writer had been exploring the world for snapshots
            of love in different cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I polished off the layout by adjusting the negative space
            between the columns and reducing the visual weight of the few
            separated paragraphs. I’m pleased with how this article and print
            design developed over the course of the day. I also appreciate the
            representation of so many cultures, reflecting the diversity of the
            SFU students reading the article.

            Working at <span class="italics">The Peak</span> taught me to craft, revise, and finalize my design work quickly, in order to complete my spreads within the tight 10-hour turnarounds. The editorial team’s shared goal is to distribute these powerful student stories. I also learned to speak up — and when necessary, take actions myself — when I feel that the message could be visually communicated more effectively.
