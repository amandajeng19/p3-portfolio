/*
	Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (SASS, https://sass-lang.com/) is a preprocessing language for CSS. It has it's own syntax, meaning you would have to learn another laguage to work with it effectively. There are some advantages to working with a language like SASS though: 
	- more legible/simpler markup
	- CSS compression 
	- reusable code 

$brand-color: #AABB12

// Instead of using the curly brackets {} to contain our properties for a selector's styling, SASS uses indenting. The code below will be processed into *{box-sizing:border-box} in our CSS.
* 
	// No ending semicolons ';' are required with property: value statements in SASS 
	box-sizing: border-box
