/* Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (SASS, https://sass-lang.com/) is a preprocessing language for CSS. It has it's own syntax, meaning you would have to learn another laguage to work with it effectively. There are some advantages to working with a language like SASS though: 
 * - more legible/simpler markup
 * - CSS compression 
 * - reusable code  */
