    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Amanda, an undergraduate design student at SFU’s School of Interactive Arts &amp; Technology. I’m currently completing my first co-op as a Digital Communications Assistant at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.</p>
    <p>My focus is in graphic and UX/UI design, but I’m also interested in psychology and education. I’d love to explore the intersection of these industries, and improve my design practice by applying knowledge of how our brains learn and process information.</p>
    <p>My experiences are a mix of design, illustration, communications, event planning, mentorship, and customer service — and I’m always willing to dive into something new! Otherwise you might find me trying new cafes, taking sky pictures, or teaching myself the ukulele.</p>
